However, PyTorch already provides a list of predefined loss functions which we can use (see [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for a full list). For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!). For our model defined above, we therefore use the module `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. "

If we call the `backward` function on the loss while the parameter gradients are non-zero from the previous batch, the new gradients would actually be added to the previous ones instead of overwriting them. This is done because a parameter might occur multiple times in a computation graph, and we need to sum the gradients in this case instead of replacing them.

        "To visualize what our model has learned, we can perform a prediction for every data point in a range of $[-0.5, 1.5]$, and visualize the predicted class as in the sample figure at the beginning of this section. This shows where the model has created decision boundaries, and which points would be classified as $0$, and which as $1$. We therefore get a background image out of blue (class 0) and orange (class 1). The spots where the model is uncertain we will see a blurry overlap. The specific code is less relevant compared to the output figure which should hopefully show us a clear separation of classes:"
